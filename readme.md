        Trigger Context: Before, When, After
        Trigger Content: actions or rhythms
        Action: action

    x Play cards
        It's a 10 second timer to play or remove cards and that goes up with each additional card.


QUESTIONS
    x Insted of (left, right), maybe it should be towards enemy, away


DESIGN
    So what I'm thinking is having a rhythm system whenever a certain symbol is triggered, that can trigger a specific thing as a way of creating an automatic system to motivate movement instead of having the player manually control it.


MAYBE
